Hello. I have been an attonrey for 14 years. It is not something I like to do anymore.
I thought I would try programming.
My hobbies include writing satire, making food items like bread, beer, cheese, etc.. from scratch, 
and trying to stay in good shape with whatever activity interests me.
I live in Thousand Oaks, which is on the outskirts of Los Angeles and on the other side of the 
mountains from Malibu.
