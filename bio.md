Hello. I have been an attonrey for 14 years. It is not something I like to do anymore.
I thought I would try programming.
My hobbies include writing satire, making food items like bread, beer, cheese, etc.. from scratch, 
and trying to stay in good shape with whatever activity interests me.

Programming Background

I haven't had any real prior programming experience prior to starting this program last summer. I 
did try to learn some programming basics on my own when I had the time.

I took 165 and it was a bit of a challenge but the prior experience I did have was on a Mac using 
Xcode I had some specific familiarity with C++. I think that made it a little easier for me.
